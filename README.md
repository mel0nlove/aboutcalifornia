Here is what I would suggest to correct the issue for Task 2:

Please watch ​​​​D277 Task 2 Section A

Please make sure you include 5 bullets

the city’s population the year the city was incorporated the region of the state in which the city is located the classification of the city: urban, suburban, and/or rural the average income level of the city compared to the rest of the state

a title element in the head of each document that describes the web page’s individual topic a relevant image, including alternative text for the image a consistent menu that allows the user to navigate to any other page on the site

While it's not required, I highly recommend using HTML comments so the WGU evaluators know you have everything listed

Please make sure you have the 4 semantic elements below

header nav section aside

While it's not required, I highly recommend using CSS comments so the WGU evaluators know you have everything listed

Please make sure you have the following tags:

a hyperlink that opens a new window or tab ordered list with at least 3 bullets unordered list with at least 3 bullets a table with at least 3 columns and 3 rows

While it's not required, I highly recommend using CSS comments so the WGU evaluators know you have everything listed

Please make sure you have the following tags: 1 font family declaration a: hover tag float property You need both absolute and relative CSS positioning 1 element selector to style the HTML elements 1 class selector that is used at least two times to style HTML elements 1 ID selector to format specific elements of a page

​​​​​​D277 Task 2 Section D

You have the following field names for the form and make sure all fields names have placeholders First name, Last name, Email address, Confirmation email A text box that allows the user to ask a question.

For the JavaScript form, you need to look over and review the following concepts: JavaScript variables JavaScript Functions Document getElementById() JavaScript Comparison Operators JavaScript if else

You will be using just 2 variables and making a statement if the emails match or don’t match.

Here is some examples on how to do this. https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-form-validation
